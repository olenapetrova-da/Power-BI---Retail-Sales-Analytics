That is an individual project based on (but not limited to) the training task at the Data Analytics course.</br>
The complete description of the project goal, my role, and the results are in the <a href="CaseStudy_RetailSales .pdf"> CaseStudy_RetailSales.pdf</a> document. </br></br>
In this project I performed the roles of all the stakeholders, including the business request provider.</br>
The Business Request is formed in a way to demonstrate technical, as well as analytical skills. </br>
Business and Requirements analysis skills were applied and helped a lot to build dashboards.
