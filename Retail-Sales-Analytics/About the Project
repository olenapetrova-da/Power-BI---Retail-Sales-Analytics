As a Business and Data Analyst, I delivered a 3-page analytical dashboard to evaluate half-a-year sales and shipments. 
Performing data exploration, I created the data model and data dictionary and defined analysis dimensions to get insights according to the business request. 
While preparing for visualization, data quality check, transformation, and additional DAX calculations were performed. 
The report allows to compare the sales share of regions and customer segments and to see the revenue and profit changes during the period respectively. 
A deeper anomaly investigation is possible. 
Shipmentsâ€™ Analytics shows the reliability of the order-to-shipment process with respect to order priority. 
Also, shipment modes are compared. Python script was used for one of the visuals. 
The Web connector to the external API was used to get currency rates.
